# Email Profile Picture Setup Guide

## üö® SPECIAL SECTION: GoDaddy + Outlook Users

**If you're using Outlook via GoDaddy email hosting (like you are), here's your specific setup:**

### Reality Check for GoDaddy + Outlook:
- ‚ùå **Outlook recipients won't see your logo** (Outlook doesn't support profile pictures from GoDaddy hosting)
- ‚úÖ **Gmail recipients WILL see your logo** (if you set up Google Account method)
- ‚úÖ **Other email clients may show it** (Yahoo, Apple Mail, etc.)

### Your Best Strategy:

#### 1. **Google Account Setup** (MOST IMPORTANT)
Even though you use Outlook, **most of your recipients probably use Gmail**. Set this up:

1. Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
2. Create account using `hello@table4six.in`
3. Upload your Table 4 Six logo as profile picture
4. **Result**: Gmail users (majority of people) will see your logo

#### 2. **Yahoo Account Setup** (Secondary)
1. Go to [yahoo.com](https://yahoo.com) 
2. Create account using `hello@table4six.in`
3. Upload your logo
4. **Result**: Yahoo users will see your logo

#### 3. **Domain Favicon** (Universal Fallback)
1. Create favicon from your logo (16x16, 32x32 px)
2. Upload to your website root (`table4six.in/favicon.ico`)
3. **Result**: Some email clients will pull this automatically

#### 4. **GoDaddy Limitations**
- GoDaddy email hosting doesn't support custom profile pictures
- You can't upgrade this without changing email providers
- Outlook desktop/web clients rarely show sender profile pictures anyway

### Quick Win Strategy:
**Focus on Google Account setup** - it covers 60%+ of email recipients who use Gmail!

3. Ask team members to check their inboxes
4. Use `npm run test:email` to send test emails

## Expected Results

- **Gmail**: Should show your logo immediately after Google account setup

- Update profile pictures when rebranding
- Check different email clients periodically
- Monitor SendGrid authentication status
